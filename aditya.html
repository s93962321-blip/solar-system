<h1>solar system</h1><br>
<ol type="1">
<li><h3><a id=sun>sun</a></h3></li><br>
The Sun is a star, the centre of our solar system, and the closest star to Earth.<br> 
It's a giant sphere of extremely hot gases, mainly hydrogen and helium. <br>
The Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core.<br>
Life on Earth is impossible without the Sun's heat and light. <br>
The Sun's rays are crucial for photosynthesis in plants, which produce our food.<br> 
It drives Earth's weather, climate, and the water cycle. <br>
The Sun's gravity keeps all planets, from Mercury to Neptune, in orbit around it.<br> 
Sunlight provides Vitamin D, which is vital for human health. <br>
The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and contains almost all the mass in our solar system. <br>
The Sun can cause dangerous ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is why we need to protect our skin.<br> <br>

<li><h3>mercury</h3></li><br>
<B>Physical Characteristics</b> <br>
<i>Size & Composition:</i> As the smallest planet, Mercury is a rocky, terrestrial world with a massive iron core.<br>
<i>Surface:</i> Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling Earth's Moon, with some smooth plains.
<i>Atmosphere: </i>It has an extremely thin atmosphere, called an exosphere, which allows heat to escape rapidly into space.<br>
<i>Magnetic Field:</i> Due to its large core, Mercury has a magnetic field, though it is only about 1% as strong as Earth's.<br>
<b>Orbit & Time</b><br>
<i>Orbit:</i> Mercury has the fastest orbit of all planets, completing one year in just 88 Earth days.<br> 
<i>Rotation:</i> A single day on Mercury is very long, lasting the equivalent of 59 Earth days.<br> 
<b>Temperature Extremes</bs><br> 
<i>Hot & Cold:</i> Surface temperatures can range from extremely hot on the sunlit side (up to 800째F or 427째C) to extremely cold on the dark side (down to -300째F or -183째C).<br>
Not the Hottest: Despite being closest to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet because its lack of atmosphere and greenhouse effect allows heat to quickly escape.<br>

<i>Day vs. Year:</i> A day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days, while its year (orbit around the Sun) is 225 Earth days. <br>
<i>No Moons:</i> Venus, along with Mercury, is one of only two planets in the solar system that has no natural satellites.<br> 
<i>"Sister Planet":</i> It's sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "evil twin" due to its similar size but extremely different, hostile environment.<br> 
<i>Brightest Object:</i> It is the brightest object in the night sky after the Moon. <br>
<i>Ancient Name:</i> The ancient Romans named the planet after their goddess of love and beauty.<br>

<li><h3>mars</h3></li><br>
<i>The Red Planet:</i> Its reddish appearance is due to rust, or iron oxide, in its soil.<br> 
<i>Location:</i Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system. <br>
<i>Two Moons:</i> It has two natural satellites, named Phobos and Deimos. <br>
<i>Size:</i> Mars is about half the size of Earth, making it the second-smallest planet in our solar system.<br> 
<i>Day and Year:</i> A Martian day is 24.6 Earth hours long, and a Martian year lasts 687 Earth days. <br>
<i>Thin Atmosphere:</i> The planet has a very thin atmosphere, roughly 100 times thinner than Earth's, composed mainly of carbon dioxide.<br 
<i>Surface Features:</i> Mars boasts a diverse surface with features like massive volcanoes, deep canyons, and impact craters. <br
<i>Dust Storms:</i> It can experience planet-wide dust storms that can last for months. <br>
<i>Weak Gravity:</i> Martian gravity is weaker than Earth's, meaning you would weigh less there.<br> 
<i>No Life (Yet):</i> While there is no known life on Mars, the planet holds clues to early Earth conditions and may have once been habitable.<br>

<li><h3>jupiter</h3></li><br>
<i>Massive Gas Giant:</i> Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.<br> 
<i>The Great Red Spot:</i> This is a persistent, enormous storm larger than Earth, located in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. <br>
<i>Faint Rings:</i> Jupiter possesses a system of rings, but they are very faint and difficult to observe without advanced equipment.<br> 
<i>Numerous Moons:</i> The planet has 95 officially recognized moons, with notable examples including Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.<br> 
<i>Rapid Rotation:</i> Jupiter spins incredibly fast, completing a rotation on its axis in less than 10 Earth hours, making for a short day.<br> 
<i>Long Year:</i> An orbit around the Sun takes approximately 11.8 Earth years for Jupiter to complete.<br> 
<i>Visible to the Naked Eye:</i> Because it is the third-brightest object in the night sky, Jupiter has been known and visible to humans since ancient times.<br> 
<i>Powerful Magnetosphere:</i> Jupiter generates a huge magnetic field, which is stronger than Earth's and helps to attract many moons.<br> 
<i>Striped Atmosphere:</i> The prominent stripes and bands are caused by fast-moving clouds of water and ammonia that flow in opposite directions. <br>
<i>Cosmic Protector:</i> Jupiter's strong gravity and massive size allow it to influence the paths of comets and asteroids, potentially protecting Earth from impacts.<br>
